          DSKMGR - A Enhanced Disk Manager for the Portable Disk Drive


     DSKMGR.CO  is  a  machine-language  program   which  provides  routine
     disk/file  management  capabilities for the Model 100 and the Portable
     Disk Drive 1. The program resides between 60700-62800 during operation
     and  executes  at 60700.  The area between 62800 and MAXRAM (62960) is
     used by the program for buffers and temporary storage.

     DSKMGR is designed for users keeping a copy in low memory and LOADMing
     for actual use only. As a result, DSKMGR CLEARs the area between HIMEM
     and MAXRAM on exit to the Model 100's Main Menu.  [ A modification  to
     disable this capability can be selected when the .CO file is created.]

     Due to the number of ROM calls used  by DSKMGR to reduce program size,
     it is currently implemented for the  Model  100  only.  If  the  press
     releases  can  be  believed, DSKMGR should work with the new Model 102
     but I have not confirmed that myself.   At the  present  time,  DSKMGR
     does  not  work  correctly  with the new TDD-2.  If enough interest is
     expressed, DSKMGR may be updated later for the TDD-2.

     DSKMGR operates much like FLOPPY.CO  (the software  provided  with the
     drive) with the following exceptions:

     1) DSKMGR  does not  contain  the  Backup  or  Rename  functions.  The
        primary  design  consideration of DSKMGR  was  size and the limited
        requirements for these utilities led to the decision not to include
        them as part of the main program.

     2) The program's  Menu  operates  similarly to the system's Main Menu.
        Files are selected  for  saving  by  highlighting  with  the  arrow
        keys/space bar and then pressing <ENTER> or F3.  One of FLOPPY.CO's
        major  drawbacks  is  the  need  to  type in all file names with no
        file listings to work from.

     3) The List function gives the user an  opportunity at the end of each
        screen to name a file  for loading from the disk.  Pressing <ENTER>
        alone will continue the listing process.

     4) DSKMGR  was  written  to  overcome  some  inherent  weaknesses  in
        FLOPPY.CO,   specifically  size  and  a  lack  of   'user-friendly
        interface'. However, new user comments  and  message threads  here
        and elsewhere have led to two additional significant differences--
        1)  .BA file loading by DSKMGR is compatible with SUPERA and other
        position-dependent BASIC program files;  2) DSKMGR will not 'grab'
        your telephone line, except upon exit to the M100 Main Menu.


                                DSKMGR FUNCTIONS
                                ================

     [F1] List - Lists  the names and sizes of all the files on the current
     disk. Files are listed in groups of 10 and the number of free bytes on
     the disk is given with the last group.   The user is given a chance at
     the end of each group to name a file for loading from disk.   Pressing
     <ENTER> alone will continue the listing.

     [F2] Load - Transfers a file  from  the  disk  to  RAM.  The  user  is
     prompted for the file's disk name  and given an opportunity to give it
     a different name for RAM.

     [F3] Save - Transfers  a  RAM  file  to disk.  The file is selected by
     highlighting its name on DSKMGR's menu, using the cursor exactly as it
     is on the Model 100's Main Menu. The user is then given  a  chance  to
     rename the file for storage on disk. Pressing  <ENTER>  alone  at  the
     "Name on disk:"  prompt  will cause DSKMGR to use the file's RAM name.
     Pressing SHIFT/BREAK or CTRL-C  will  abort the  Save.  <ENTER> may be
     used instead of F3 to activate the Save routine.

     [F4] Sval - Automatically saves all visible  RAM  files to disk.   The
     user is given a chance to rename each file just before it is saved  to
     disk.   Pressing <ENTER> alone will cause DSKMGR to use the file's RAM
     name.  Pressing SHIFT/BREAK or CTRL-C will abort the rest of the  Save
     All routine.

     [F5] Eras - Deletes a file from the current disk. The user is prompted
     for the name and asked to confirm the action.

     [F6] Kill - Kills the RAM file currently highlighted on DSKMGR's menu.
     The user is asked to confirm the action before it is carried out.

     [F7] Frmt - Formats  the  disk currently in the drive.   The  user  is
     warned that any data on the disk will be lost and asked to confirm the
     action.

     [F8] Menu - Exits DSKMGR and returns to the Model 100's Main Menu.

     <ENTER> - Saves the file currently  highlighted on  the  menu.  May be
     used instead of F3.


                            DOWNLOAD & INSTALLATION
                            =======================

     Due to the large number of questions  surrounding  the  hex-conversion
     method  of  downloading  previous releases of DSKMGR, I have chosen to
     make this version available as a BASIC program which will  create  the
     .CO  program  file.  This has the added attraction of allowing certain
     user options to be specified at the  time  DSKMGR  is  created.   This
     change  should  alleviate  the other major source of problems -- using
     options that were previously carried in DSKMGR.ADD.

     A quick word here about downloading... I highly recommend using a file
     transfer protocol to get DSKMGR.302 rather than a simple ASCII capture
     download.   The Christensen protocol  (called XMODEM after the program
     where it was first implemented) is  widely available, well-documented,
     and  very  reliable.  DSKMGR.302  has  an  internal checksum that will
     verify the accuracy of the .CO file.  If it reports a checksum  error,
     DO  NOT  try  to  run  DSKMGR.CO anyway!  You will almost certainly be
     buying your Model 100 a round-trip ticket to the frozen North and your
     memos and spreadsheets will be the baggage that gets lost on the way.

     After downloading DSKMGR.302, load it into the BASIC  interpreter  and
     run  it.  The  addresses  where the program resides will be printed on
     the screen as each byte is moved into place.   When the screen clears,
     the program will ask about three optional changes that can be made.

     As written, DSKMGR is self-clearing, i.e., on exit the variable  HIMEM
     is  reset to MAXRAM.  This frees the 2.2K of RAM used by DSKMGR during
     execution.  As a result of limitations in the  8085  assembly-language
     command  set,  .CO  files  in the Model 100 must be loaded to specific
     addresses  before  execution.   Since  the  RAM  just below the system
     variables is the last to be used for file  storage,  most  programmers
     choose this area to assemble their programs.  This also means most .CO
     files will conflict with each other.   By clearing 'high memory' after
     use,  DSKMGR  insures  its code is not corrupted accidentally by other
     programs and then executed.

     Some  users  have  memory  management techniques that assume .CO files
     will reside permanently above HIMEM.  For those users,  DSKMGR  offers
     an option to defeat its self-clearing routine.  To do so, just respond
     'N' when asked 'Self-clearing?'.

     DSKMGR  uses  BEEPs to signal successful completion of commands and to
     announce error reports.  If you  prefer  to  use  DSKMGR  without  the
     BEEPs, respond 'N' when asked 'Sound?'.

     Since DSKMGR was first released, other vendors have begun distributing
     the drive as well.  One major difference between  the  TDD  and  these
     other  drives  is  the transmission rate.  The TDD has selectable baud
     rates and uses 19200 baud for normal transfers. Some of the others are
     hard-wired for 9600 baud. If your drive needs the slower speed, select
     'N' when asked 'High-Speed?'.

     When  the  options are set, the program returns to the Main Menu.  Two
     new files will be there -- DSKMGR.CO and DRIVER.DO.  The .DO file is a
     program  line  to  be loaded into BASIC and saved as DSKMGR.BA.  After
     creating the BASIC file, the .DO file can be deleted.   When  run, the
     new BASIC program will automatically load and execute DSKMGR.CO.

                       FINAL COMMENTS & ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
                       =================================

     The reaction to DSKMGR over the past year has been overwhelming. There
     have been literally hundreds of Model 100 users who have chosen to use
     DSKMGR with their Portable Disk Drive.  To all of you who have written
     to me with suggestions,  questions,  and words of praise, I would like
     to say thank you.  Without your  help and encouragement,  DSKMGR would
     never have become what it is.

     However, the cost of supporting DSKMGR on-line has been enormous.  For
     that reason,  I am asking users to make a donation.  Unlike  shareware
     which specifies a registration fee for continued use after evaluation,
     all I am asking is this:  If you are  using  DSKMGR,  please  consider
     what its value is to you and then  consider  making  out a check.  The
     level  of  support  I  can continue to give to DSKMGR as well as other
     new program developments will depend on you.

     As  with  previous versions of DSKMGR, this program is provided solely

                              DSKMGR ERROR CODES
                              ==================


     DSKMGR uses two-letter error codes to reduce memory requirements.  The
     following error messages are possible with DSKMGR:


     Ok  Flashes  briefly  on  the  message  line  (Line 7)  to  indicate a 
         function has been successfully completed. 

     NR  Drive  is  not ready.  This error will be reported if the drive is 
         not powered-up and  connected  to  the  computer  before  entering 
         DSKMGR.  Check power switch and cable connection, then try command 
         again. 

     CM  Communications  error.  Results  from  a bad connection or similar
         transmission problem. Check cable and try again.

     AB  Command aborted.  Sent  when  BREAK or CTRL-C is pressed at a user
         prompt.

     FF  File not found.

     AE  File already exists.

     OM  Out of space.  Returned  when there is insufficient room to save a 
         file to disk or load a file into RAM. 

     WP  Disk is write-protected. The write-protection tab on the disk must 
         be moved to the OFF position before data can be written to it. 

     HT  Hardware  error.  This  is the one you don't want to get. Turn the 
         drive off and on,  then try the command again.  If  the  HT  error 
         comes up again, you got TROUBLE! 

     IO  Input/Output error.  This  usually  comes  up when a read/write is 
         attempted  with  an unformatted disk.  It will also be reported if 
         the disk has become corrupt. 

     ND  No disk in drive.

     BF  Bad file type.  This error prevents reading or writing a file that 
         cannot be handled by the Model 100. 

     FE  File empty.  Prevents saving a null file to disk.
